This basic web app was used to learn about the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, and Node.js). 

The front-end website is a single-page application made in React, while the back-end is a Node server that exposes a MongoDB database via a REST API.

This web app is not currently hosted anywhere.

This was the final project submitted to Oregon State University's CS 290 Web Development class. Grade Received: 100%
